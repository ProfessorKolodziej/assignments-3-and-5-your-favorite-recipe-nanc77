				<p>Yep, this fun train just keeps chugging on down the tracks and ope, here we are for a delicious little
					stop
					in
					Noodle Town! The very best of towns. These are perfectly spicy noodles, swimming around in a
					ginger-spiked
					broth, ready for all your slurpiest noodle needs.</p>
				<p>The short ribs are the most tender, the most fall-apart, the most worthy of tears because how are they so
					gooood?! Just peeking out on top of your noodle-y pile, next to some bright sautéed spinach, sprinkled
					with
					sesame seeds and swizzled with a little toasted sesame oil. Oh my. Oh my, oh my.</p>

			<h2>What Is Gochujang Sauce?</h2>
			<div class="content-text">
				<p>This little noodle-y wonder gets its deep and interesting spice from the gochujang sauce. If you're not
					familiar,
					it is a sauce made from gochujang — a staple ingredient in Korean cooking with an absolutely delicious
					lingering
					heat and strong umami flavor — mixed with some other ingredients like soy sauce, vinegar, and a
					sweetener.
					Gochujang itself is a spicy-sweet-savory paste that is made from fermented soybeans, red chile pepper
					flakes,
					sticky rice, and salt and it is commonly used to flavor meat dishes, soups and stews, and sauces. You can
					read
					a
					little more about how it's made and used from Christina Chaey over at Bon Appetit.</p>

			<h2>How To Make This Spicy Short Rib Noodle Soup</h2>
			<div class="content-text">
				<p>Because we've got our ol' pal the Instant Pot working for us here, things come together relatively
					simply.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Short Ribs. Season generously with salt and then pop them in the IP on sauté mode without disturbing
						them
						until browned on the outside.</li>
					<li>Flavor it up. Add gochujang sauce, tomato paste, ginger, garlic, and shallots to the IP and let that
						go
						for
						a bit, then add the broth.</li>
					<li>Cook. High presh for 30 minutes. When done, that meat will be so beautifully tender.</li>
					<li>Noodles! Set to the sauté mode again and add the noodles and cook until softened.</li>
					<li>Spinach. Sauté in a separate pan and then add to your soup (optional, but such a nice bright add-in).
						You
						could also toss it right into the pot if that's your jam!</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Serve your soup bowls topped with the fall-apart short ribs, tuck in your sautéed spinach, sprinkle with
					scallions, sesame seeds, and sesame oil. YUM!</p>

			<h2>Instant Pot Spicy Short Rib Noodle Soup: Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			<div class="content-text">
				<p><strong>Is there a difference between gochujang and gochujang sauce?</strong></p>
				<p>Yes! This recipe uses gochujang sauce, which has a different taste and spice level than straight
					gochujang
					paste
					since it is mixed with other ingredients. If you can only find gochujang paste, consider adding a splash
					of
					soy
					sauce and perhaps a bit of honey or sugar to balance things out.</p>
				<p><strong>Can I make this vegetarian?</strong></p>
				<p>Absolutely! Just use veggie broth and either plop some delicious marinated crispy tofu or oven-roasted
					mushrooms
					on top for extra flavor.</p>
				<p><strong>How can I make this without an Instant Pot?</strong></p>
				<p>Sear the short ribs in large pot on the stove in a little bit of oil until there's a beautiful browned
					crust.
					Remove the short ribs from the pot and add in the tomato paste, gochujang sauce, ginger, shallots, and
					garlic
					and cook for a few minutes until the aromatics are translucent. Add in the beef broth and add the short
					ribs
					back to the pot. Simmer on low for a few hours until the short ribs are tender and start to fall apart.
					Add
					in
					your noodles and cook through.</p>

				<h4>Ingredients</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>1 pound <strong>short ribs</strong> (meat removed from bone, fat trimmed, cut into smallish chunks)
					</li>
					<li>1 tablespoon <strong>gochujang sauce</strong> (more gochujang = more spicy! I would say this amount
						is
						medium spicy)</li>
					<li>1 tablespoon <strong>tomato paste</strong></li>
					<li>1 tablespoon minced <strong>fresh ginger</strong></li>
					<li>6 cloves <strong>garlic</strong>, crushed/minced</li>
					<li>1 shallot, thinly sliced</li>
					<li>4-6 cups <strong>beef broth</strong></li>
					<li>10-16 ounces <strong>dry ramen noodles</strong> or any other stir-fry noodles (I use 2-3 individual
						serving
						size packages)
					</li>
					<li>spinach (optional)</li>
					<li>scallions, sesame seeds, and/or sesame oil on top</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Instructions</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Set Instant Pot to the sauté mode. Sprinkle short ribs generously with salt; sauté without disturbing
						them
						until browned on the outside.</li>
					<li>Add gochujang, tomato paste, ginger, garlic, and shallots to the Instant Pot with the short ribs and
						sauté
						for 1-2 minutes.</li>
					<li>Add broth. Cook on high pressure for 30 minutes. When the cook time is up, the meat should be
						extremely
						tender and yummy.</li>
					<li>Set to the sauté mode again. Add noodles and cook until the noodles are softened. Taste broth and
						season
						with salt, pepper, maybe a shot of rice vinegar? and anything else you want.</li>
					<li>Sauté spinach in a separate pan (optional).</li>
					<li>Serve noodle soup bowls topped with the short ribs, sautéed spinach, scallion, sesame seeds, and
						sesame
						oil.
					</li>
				</ol>
