		<p>Yep, this fun train just keeps chugging on down the tracks and ope, here we are for a delicious little stop in
			Noodle Town! The very best of towns. These are perfectly spicy noodles, swimming around in a ginger-spiked
			broth, ready for all your slurpiest noodle needs.</p>
		<p>The short ribs are the most tender, the most fall-apart, the most worthy of tears because how are they so
			gooood?! Just peeking out on top of your noodle-y pile, next to some bright sautéed spinach, sprinkled with
			sesame seeds and swizzled with a little toasted sesame oil. Oh my. Oh my, oh my.</p>

		<h2>What Is Gochujang Sauce?</h2>
		<p>This little noodle-y wonder gets its deep and interesting spice from the gochujang sauce. If you're not
			familiar,
			it is a sauce made from gochujang — a staple ingredient in Korean cooking with an absolutely delicious
			lingering
			heat and strong umami flavor — mixed with some other ingredients like soy sauce, vinegar, and a sweetener.
			Gochujang itself is a spicy-sweet-savory paste that is made from fermented soybeans, red chile pepper flakes,
			sticky rice, and salt and it is commonly used to flavor meat dishes, soups and stews, and sauces. You can read
			a
			little more about how it's made and used from Christina Chaey over at Bon Appetit.</p>

		<h2>Ingredients For Short Rib Noodle Soup</h2>
		<p>Because the gochujang sauce brings so much depth of flavor, especially when paired up with aromatics like
			ginger
			and garlic, the ingredient list itself isn't too long!</p>
		<ul>
			<li>trimmed short ribs, removed from the bone (it's worth it to trim/prep before cooking for a top-notch soup
				experience)</li>
			<li>gochujang sauce</li>
			<li>tomato paste</li>
			<li>minced fresh ginger, garlic &amp; shallot</li>
			<li>beef broth</li>
			<li>dry ramen noodles or any other stir-fry noodles</li>
			<li>spinach</li>
			<li>scallions, sesame seeds, and/or sesame oil for finishing</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>How To Make This Spicy Short Rib Noodle Soup</h2>
		<p>Because we've got our ol' pal the Instant Pot working for us here, things come together relatively simply.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Short Ribs. Season generously with salt and then pop them in the IP on sauté mode without disturbing them
				until browned on the outside.</li>
			<li>Flavor it up. Add gochujang sauce, tomato paste, ginger, garlic, and shallots to the IP and let that go for
				a bit, then add the broth.</li>
			<li>Cook. High presh for 30 minutes. When done, that meat will be so beautifully tender.</li>
			<li>Noodles! Set to the sauté mode again and add the noodles and cook until softened.</li>
			<li>Spinach. Sauté in a separate pan and then add to your soup (optional, but such a nice bright add-in). You
				could also toss it right into the pot if that's your jam!</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Serve your soup bowls topped with the fall-apart short ribs, tuck in your sautéed spinach, sprinkle with
			scallions, sesame seeds, and sesame oil. YUM!</p>

		<h2>Instant Pot Spicy Short Rib Noodle Soup: Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
		<p><strong>Is there a difference between gochujang and gochujang sauce?</strong></p>
		<p>Yes! This recipe uses gochujang sauce, which has a different taste and spice level than straight gochujang
			paste
			since it is mixed with other ingredients. If you can only find gochujang paste, consider adding a splash of soy
			sauce and perhaps a bit of honey or sugar to balance things out.</p>
		<p><strong>Can I make this vegetarian?</strong></p>
		<p>Absolutely! Just use veggie broth and either plop some delicious marinated crispy tofu or oven-roasted
			mushrooms
			on top for extra flavor.</p>
		<p><strong>How can I make this without an Instant Pot?</strong></p>
		<p>Sear the short ribs in large pot on the stove in a little bit of oil until there's a beautiful browned crust.
			Remove the short ribs from the pot and add in the tomato paste, gochujang sauce, ginger, shallots, and garlic
			and cook for a few minutes until the aromatics are translucent. Add in the beef broth and add the short ribs
			back to the pot. Simmer on low for a few hours until the short ribs are tender and start to fall apart. Add in
			your noodles and cook through.</p>

			<h4>Ingredients</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>1 pound <strong>short ribs</strong> (meat removed from bone, fat trimmed, cut into smallish chunks)</li>

				<li>1 shallot, thinly sliced</li>

				<li>scallions, sesame seeds, and/or sesame oil on top</li>
